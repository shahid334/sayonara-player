# Sayonara Player #

All downloads are removed from here. You can find them on http://sayonara-player.com from now on.

The goal of Sayonara is to be a small, clear, not yet platform-independent music player. Low CPU usage, low memory consumption and no long loading times are only three benefits of this player. Sayonara should be easy and intuitive to use and therefore it should be able to compete with the most popular music players. Currently it is only available for Linux
