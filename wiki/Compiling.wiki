= How to compile Sayonara =


You can get the most recent version on the svn server

  * svn checkout http://sayonara-player.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ sayonara-player-read-only

There is also a source archive in the [http://code.google.com/p/sayonara-player/downloads/list Download] section. It is not the most recent version, but the version of the latest release

== Libraries ==

  * Cmake
  * Qt >= 4.7: Gui, Core, Phonon, Xml, Sqlite http://qt.nokia.com/products/
  * libcurl http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/
  * Taglib http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html
  * Gstreamer development files, GStreamer plugins


== Linux ==

  In order to compile Sayonara you have to use cmake now.

  * cmake .
  * make
  * make install (as root)

  Sayonara player itself and the Gstreamer backend are built and installed automatically. The Phonon Backend has to be built separately in the Engine/Phonon directory.

  Debian packages can be created by executing the *2debian.sh scripts in the linux_packages folder

== Windows ==

Not supported yet

== MAC ==

Same as for Linux, try to fetch all packages with MacPorts.
