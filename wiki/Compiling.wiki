= How to compile Sayonara =

*Please consider that this player is still in development, Much of the functionality is visible, but maybe not working. The player seems to compile and run on most systems but there were no extended tests*

Please wait until end of June before telling us and the world, that this player isn't running on your system...

== Libraries ==

  * Qt: Gui, Core, Phonon, Xml, Sqlite http://qt.nokia.com/products/
  * libcurl http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

There is a Visual Studio 2008 solution, but not updated every time, so maybe the project will miss a few files

  * Known issues:
    # Some MP3 files are not played due to some Phonon issue
