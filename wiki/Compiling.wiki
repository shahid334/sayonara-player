= How to compile Sayonara =

*Please consider that this player is still in development, Much of the functionality is visible, but maybe not working. The player seems to compile and run on most systems but there were no extended tests*

Please wait until end of June before telling us and the world, that this player isn't running on your system...

== Libraries ==

  * Qt: Gui, Core, Phonon, Xml, Sqlite http://qt.nokia.com/products/
  * libcurl http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/
  * Taglib http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html


== Linux ==

  * qmake
  * make
  * make install <br>

  * Known issue: After installing, the .Sayonara directory in your home folder may only be owned by the root user. So you may have trouble with the database. Please change the owner manually to your user before starting the player the first time


== Windows ==

On Windows you have to set environment variables:
There is a Visual Studio 2008 solution, but not updated every time, so maybe the project will miss a few files

  * Qt:      QTDIR
  * Taglib:  LIBTAG
  * libcurl: CURL

  * Known issues:
    # Some MP3 files are not played due to some Phonon issue (the standard Windows DirectX backend fails, so the next step will contain compilation of an alternative backend e.g. gstreamer under Windows)
   


== MAC ==

Is there anybody out there who wants to try compilation on MAC OSX?
